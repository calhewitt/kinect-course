# Kinect Course

## Part 1: Writing a simple program in Scratch

To get the Kinect sensor up and running, you will need 2 programs installed on your computer, these are [Scratch itself](http://scratch.mit.edu/scratch_1.4/) (obviously) and a tool called [Kinect2Scratch](http://scratch.saorog.com/). The both should be installed already, but if not just click the links to download them. 

To start off, connect the sensor to your computer (make sure both the USB cable and the power socket are plugged in) and fire up Kinect2Scratch. Once the window has loaded, click on the 'Launch Kinect' button. It should look something like this: 

<br><img src = "images/kinect2scratch-output.png" width=500><br><br>

By the way, if the program seems to crash without explanation, it is probably because the Kinect isn't properly connected. Check all of the wires and try again.

The Kinect sensor has two cameras, one which detects visible light like our eyes (the image on the right), and another which can see the distance of objects from it. This depth sensor is the image you can see on the left; try moving an object at different distances from the sensor and see what happens.

Once the sensor has been started, open up Scratch and create a new project.

The simple moving blob






## Part 2: Tracking Multiple Joints

Make a stick man

## Part 3: A lovely game

Eg. pong, the best game :)

## Part 4: C# basics

Make a helloworld c# app; terminal/winforms/wpf?

## Part 5: Making the Kinect work with C#

Make the moving blob and stickman etc. in C#

## Part 6: Making a Kinect program

Something more complex in C#, eg. a stickman or game or something?
